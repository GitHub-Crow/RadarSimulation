% specify_parameters.m
%
% Run this program first to set up parameters for each data run.  The run
% parameters are stored in the file "CD_run_params.mat" in the current
% directory.  The program "extract_data.m" reads this file and adds some
% fixed radar parameters to the file.  Subsequent programs can read this
% file to obtain the parameters needed for the SAR processing.
%
% The radar data are stored on the CD supplied with the book, but they 
% can be read from a disk file copied from the CD to your hard drive.
%
% The only file needed from the CD is "dat_01.001", which contains the
% radar data as well as the chirp replica and auxiliary data for each range
% line.  As none of the parameters like PRF and range gate delay change in
% this data set, and the replica is well defined by a linear FM chirp, the
% only data that are really needed from the CD is the raw radar signal data
% contained in "dat_01.001".  The radar parameters are stored in the
% program "extract_data.m".
%
% The radar data can be written in one block, or broken up into a number of
% blocks, with a set of files for each block.
%
% The first range cell and the number of range cells can be set to any
% value within the boundaries of the data array.  The first range line
% should be set to 1 plus a multiple of 8, and the number of lines per
% block set to a factor of 8.  Also, the number of lines should be set to a
% multiple of the number of lines per block.  If these rules are not
% obeyed, the "extract_data.m" program will quantize the values accordingly.

% Parameters to specify for each run:
% -----------------------------------
% input_path    : location of the radar data file 'dat_01.001' 
% output_path   : location for the extracted data files
% output_prefix : prefix to the extracted data file names
%
% first_rg_cell : first range cell to extract
% Nrg_cells     : number of range cells to extract
% first_rg_line : first range line (azimuth sample) to extract
% Nrg_lines     : number of range lines to extract
% Nrg_lines_blk : number of range lines per block
% UseMATfiles   : Set to 0 if you want binary header, data, aux and replica 
%                 files (.DAT) rather than just the MATLAB data files (.MAT)

%             - moved fixed parameters to "extract_data.m"
%             - now use a fixed parameter file name for all programs
%             - added UseMATfiles option (=1 for MAT files)
